# concalcjavascript
The purpose of this program was to practice JavaScript programming utilizing webpack so multiple JavaScript modules can be used. There will eventually be a server version that 
will be databaswe driven to render diferent calculations. There is also a PHP version that will utilize MySQL tp render the calculations. JavaScript on the client side can't use 
MySQL so all was hard coded.This is a work in progress.
